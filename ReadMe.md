Gameplay:
	You are a hunter in a system of caves, find your way around using the movement keys, if you see a cave with a red boundary
this signals that the Wumpus is less than 2 blocks away. Once you think you know where the wumpus is press the fire button and then 
use the movement keys to indicate which direction to fire in.

Game Setup:
	This game was designed and implemented for my final project for the Data Structures course at Colby College(CS 231). 
	The game is written in Java and you will need to use the terminal to enter the project folder, then compile all the code 
	using javac *.java, finally use java HuntTheWumpus to run the program.

Good Luck !
